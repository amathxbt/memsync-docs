### Troubleshooting

#### Windows Installation
If you are on Windows and encounter errors installing dependencies, we recommend using **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**. 
1. Run `wsl --install` in PowerShell.
2. Restart and install the requirements within the WSL terminal.

#### Dependency Conflicts
If `npm install` fails, try clearing your cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Follow the existing structure and formatting
2. Test changes locally before submitting
3. Ensure all links and references work correctly
4. Update navigation in `docs.json` if adding new pages

## Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch.
